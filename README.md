# Reuter_2025_PlaqueAnalysis
Ilastik segmentation model and code for processing segmentation results for the paper "" by M. Reuter et al. 2025. Please refer to the [Ilastik documentation](https://www.ilastik.org/) for details on how the program works, and to our paper to learn how it was used there.

## Ilastik model
The "Ilastik" folder contains the compressed classifier file "PlaqueAssay.ilp.zip" and a folder with the training images (10 .tif files). To use the classifier, first download and unzip it in a directory. You'll also need to have the associated training images in a directory. Upon loading the classifier, it will prompt a message that it can't find the images (see the image below). You'll need to manually give the paths to them, and then this new path will be saved for when you re-open the classifier.
