# Reuter 2025
Here's the code of the paper "Single capsid mutations modulating phage adsorption, persistence, and plaque morphology shape evolutionary trajectories in Î¦X174" by M. Reuter et al.

Inside each folder there's a `.md` file that has corresponding details for each analysis type

The different folders correspond to different types of analysis:
- Folder "Data_analysis": Contains code to for analysing and visualising phage and bacteria counts as well as morphological data for phage plaques.
- Folder "Plaque_analysis": Contains code for the image analysis (Segmentation model, code for processing segmentation results) of plaque plaques used to extract plaque morphology data (i.e. plaque area and turbidity)
- Folder "Simulations": Contains code for the simulations of the transfer regimes

If you used any of our code, or use its information, please cite the paper:
